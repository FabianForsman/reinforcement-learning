# Reinforcement Learning Projects

A collection of reinforcement learning implementations and experiments, built from scratch and using popular frameworks

---

## Project Goals

- Understand and implement core RL algorithms from first principles
- Train agents in custom or classical environments
- Easily swap and extend environments, agents, or reward functions
- Stay lightweight â€” no dependency on frameworks like Gym or stable-baselines (unless added intentionally)
